This is first use of jekyll so going to practice with some techniques within this post.

###Header 3

This is a random bit of text that can be entered and displayed as a p tag and this is how a [Link](https://github.com/stormcreative) would look.

If I wanted to add some code to demonstrate a scenario or a problem it will look like this:
{% capture text %}
<body>
  <div id="sidebar">  </div>
  <div id="main">
    |.{content}.|
  </div>
</body>
{% endcapture %}
{% include JB/liquid_raw %}

&hellip; but if I wanted to have a quote or a line of code to put in the command line it would look like this `git status`.
